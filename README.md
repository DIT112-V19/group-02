## SafeSweeper (Group-02)
*A Cheap and Safe way of Disabling Land Mines*

### Who?
We are seven software developers (listed at the bottom) aimed at delivering a product to our client team (listed below) who are looking for innovative car that could add value to the client and the society as a whole.

### What?
A cheap, small, remotely driven car with the capabilities of detecting mines underneath to enable them to be safely disarmed.
This project relates to development of mobile application that interacts and control a small car hardware which is operated by a software that are described in detail below.

### Why?
Each year, over [5000](http://www.the-monitor.org/en-gb/reports/2017/landmine-monitor-2017/casualties.aspx) people are injured by land mines. Most of those are civilians, which makes this a huge humanitarian issue.
Disabling land mines could be unsafe for humans and animals involved. The use of a light weight small car with capability of moving through a specific field by avoiding obstacles would facilitate the process realising the aforementioned purpose.

### Hardware
The following are some of the hardware that are currently selected. As the project develops, the list could be updated depending on the need of the project which aims to provide a satisfactory product for the client.
The use of RFID and its reader could model the mines and the sensor respectively.

* Smartcar chassis
* Smartcar shield
* Arduino Mega
* Arduino Bluetooth module
* L293D H-bridge
* GY-50 gyroscope module
* Odometers

### Software
The use of Arduino and Android libraries would essential. And the developers are aiming to develop necessary methods to complete the project.
* [smartcar](https://github.com/platisd/smartcar_shield) - Library for Arduino based vehicles
* [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) - IDE for Android applications
* [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software) - IDE for Arduino boards
